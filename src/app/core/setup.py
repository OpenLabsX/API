    This function initializes a FastAPI application and configures it with various settings
    and handlers based on the type of the `settings` object provided.

    Args:
    ----
    router (APIRouter): The APIRouter object containing the routes to be included in the FastAPI application.

    settings: An instance representing the settings for configuring the FastAPI application.
        It determines the configuration applied:

        - AppSettings: Configures basic app metadata like name, description, contact, and license info.
        - DatabaseSettings: Adds event handlers for initializing database tables during startup.

    create_tables_on_start (bool): A flag to indicate whether to create database tables on application startup. Defaults to True.

    **kwargs (Any): Additional keyword arguments passed directly to the FastAPI constructor.

    Returns:
    -------
        FastAPI: A fully configured FastAPI application instance.

    The function configures the FastAPI application with different features and behaviors
    based on the provided settings. It includes setting up database connections, Redis pools
    for caching, queue, and rate limiting, client-side caching, and customizing the API documentation
    based on the environment settings.
